Hi Mark,

I've been a bit quiet over Xmas/New Year, but haven't forgotten the comments.

//I have built beta 13, the only build errors I found were to do with repeated
//definitions of "repeater" in Exports.cpp, Imports.cpp, Names.cpp and
//Xref.cpp, solution was to make all but one extern. The problem was there in
//earlier builds, but I forgot that I had done the modification.

Now moved into the class definitions. Build 15.

As part of the build VC++ issued a number of warnings, most were for unknown
pragma, however the following additional warnings may be of interest

//Disasm.cpp(43) : warning C4018: '!=' : signed/unsigned mismatch

procnames.num changed to a dword.

//Disasm.cpp(134) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch

loop counter now unsigned.

//Disasm.cpp(281) : warning C4018: '>' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Disasm.cpp(337) : warning C4018: '>' : signed/unsigned mismatch

i now unsigned

//Disasm.cpp(1236) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'unsigned short' to
//'unsigned char', possible loss of data
//Disasm.cpp(1249) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'unsigned short' to
//'unsigned char', possible loss of data
//Disasm.cpp(1262) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'unsigned short' to
//'unsigned char', possible loss of data

rm is now a word.

//Disasm.cpp(1643) : warning C4146: unary minus operator applied to unsigned
//type, result still unsigned
//Disasm.cpp(1675) : warning C4146: unary minus operator applied to unsigned
//type, result still unsigned

0 added at the start to change the unary minus into a binary minus. Should work ok.

//Disasm.cpp(1814) : warning C4018: '<=' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Disasm.cpp(1854) : warning C4018: '<=' : signed/unsigned mismatch

usersel changed to a UINT

//Fileload.cpp(231) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Fileload.cpp(273) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Fileload.cpp(494) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Fileload.cpp(503) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Fileload.cpp(597) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Fileload.cpp(833) : warning C4018: '==' : signed/unsigned mismatch

changed 'j' to a dword. procnames.num already changed.

//Mainwind.cpp(73) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch
//Mainwind.cpp(144) : warning C4018: '<' : signed/unsigned mismatch

lastline changed to UINT.

Of course I could have introduced more signed/unsigned mismatchs with some of these
changes...

//A further idea which may improve application closure would be to define some
//global variable or an static variable for each list, which the ~slist
//function would check. If clear then process as now, if set then skip the
//delete functions. If the variable was initialised to 0 and then set to a non
//zero value as the last action in WinMain before exiting, the application
//would not have to process all the deletes and could instead let the OS free
//memory.

I'm not sure whether the problem seems to stem from thread priorities at times.
I'll keep this in mind, unless you want to come up with some code...

I'll update the build on the web site later in the week with these changes. 

Cronos.
